# Software factory

A reusable, project-local workflow for setting up a project, planning and tracking work, coordinating implementation workers, independently validating the product, and integrating completed tasks. This skill is intended to be copied into a project and customized there; do not assume a global installation or a particular harness or task system.

## Start here

1. Read the relevant project instructions (`AGENTS.md`), `PRODUCT/`, `ARCHITECTURE/`, task-system documentation, and this skill's applicable references.
2. For first-time setup, follow [setup](references/setup.md). Reconcile existing project documentation; do not overwrite useful material blindly.
3. For ongoing work, use [orchestrator](references/orchestrator.md). For an assigned implementation task, use [worker](references/worker.md). For integration, see [integration](references/integration.md). For periodic reviews, see [audits](references/audits.md).
4. Load the matching task-management, agent-harness, and build/QA references. If an integration is missing or underspecified, tell the user and agree on it before proceeding; do not pretend a placeholder is a working adapter.

## Planning pipeline

1. Capture scrap ideas in root `BACKLOG.md`.
2. Promote selected ideas to official tasks in `TASKS/KANBAN/`, GitHub, Jira, or the chosen task system. Promotion does not mean ready for a worker.
3. When fleshing out a task, the orchestrator creates `TASKS/WIP/<task>/`, named after the task, with `brainstorm.md` and `todos.md` copied from the planning and execution templates. Link this directory from the official task.
4. Gather the user's initial details, then iterate appended Q&A rounds in `brainstorm.md`; the user answers inline and the orchestrator inspects relevant code. Continue until both agree the requirements, acceptance criteria, and QA plan are explicit enough for isolated implementation.
5. The orchestrator writes a detailed, ordered checkbox plan in `todos.md`, then verifies a clean, committed `main` including the planning documents. It creates `.worktrees/<task-name>` on matching branch `<task-name>` and launches the worker in that worktree with the official task reference and both WIP documents. No task may begin implementation without these populated documents and its orchestrator-provisioned worktree.

See [orchestrator](references/orchestrator.md) for the file-based brainstorming procedure and dispatch checks. Use the `brainstorm.md` and `todos.md` templates for the task-local documents.

## Operating principles

- The orchestrator owns the human conversation, task selection, planning, dispatch, and coordination. Workers implement bounded, agreed tasks.
- Plan substantial product, scope, and architecture uncertainties with the user before dispatch. Record the Q&A in the required `TASKS/WIP/<task>/brainstorm.md` and the agreed execution plan in `todos.md`. Workers may resolve smaller implementation details, but should not reopen user-level planning; if a human decision is genuinely needed, they mark the task blocked in the shared task system and notify the orchestrator when possible.
- Once the user authorizes autonomous execution, keep selecting and dispatching ready tasks until told to stop. Periodically inspect in-flight work and surface blockers. Default to at most three concurrent work items unless the user chooses another limit. Avoid overlapping write scopes.
- Keep the human and orchestrator looking at the same operational state: task status, blockers, progress, ownership/liveness, and outcomes must not be hidden inside a worker session or worktree.
- Prefer TDD and thin end-to-end tracer-bullet slices, adapted to the user's project and preferences. Verify the actual product independently of the implementation; tests and code review alone are not product QA.
- Structure `ARCHITECTURE/` as terse, noun-based component documentation. For each component, capture its purpose, prominent technology choices, important APIs, relevant data schemas, and class/extension hierarchy. See [setup](references/setup.md) and the [component template](references/templates/architecture-component.md); avoid source-code tours and redundant prose.
- Workers own task implementation, validation, and routine integration. Automated checks may reject work; workers should fix and retry while making progress, and mark the task blocked when stuck. Routine local integration does not authorize remote push or publication.
- Every task worker always works in its own Git worktree, including documentation-only tasks and single-worker runs. The orchestrator alone provisions `<repo>/.worktrees/<task-name>` on branch `<task-name>` from clean, committed `main` and starts the worker there. Workers do not create worktrees; no shared-checkout fallback. If Git isolation cannot be established, block dispatch. Keep task bookkeeping visible and document completed work.
- Strong defaults are adaptable. Ask during setup about task system, harness, concurrency/subworkers, engineering practices, and QA affordances.
